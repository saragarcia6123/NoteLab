### An experimental full-stack Python application for data science and ML.

## Description
The project is still WIP and in its early stages.
The end goal is a semi-automated Data Science/ML workbench.
The initial idea is to develop a prototype with Flask and SQLite.
It currently uses Streamlit for the Front-End.
However in the long run, PyQT is more appropriate and will be used instead.
The modularity is set up such that the tech stack can be easily changed later on.
